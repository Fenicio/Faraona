Faraona
=======

Faraona is going to be yet another platform for blogging, this time in Meteor. Again.

When its done it will form my personal blog which I've been telling myself to make for a long time.

When the owner of the blog is connected he can activate the chatroom, allowing visitors and subscribers to interact with the writer.

The writer could show himself through the webcam if he desires (I currently have no idea how to do this).

This project has been abandoned and started as a way of getting the handle of Meteor.js, it's been left here instead of deleted for archeology purposes
